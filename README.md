# Movie-Genre-Casestudy
Statistical analysis on movie genre

### MovieLens Case Study

The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The data is widely used for collaborative filtering and other filtering solutions. However, we will be using this data to act as a means to demonstrate our skill in using Python to “play” with data.

### Datasets Information:

- **ratings.csv:** It contains information on ratings given by the users to a particular movie. Columns: user id, movie id, rating, timestamp

- **movie.csv:** The file contains information related to the movies and their genre. Columns: movie id, movie title, release date, unknown, Action, Adventure, Animation, Children’s, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Fantasy, Film-Noir, Horror, Musical, Mystery, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller, War, Western

- **user.csv:** It contains information about the users who have rated the movies.. Columns: user id, age, gender, occupation, zip code

### Objective:

`To extract insights from the dataset`

### Learning Outcomes:
`Use of Pandas Functions - shape, describe, groupby, merge etc.`


#### Domain 

`Internet and Entertainment`


#### Conclusion

### We have just learned how to use the pandas cut() function to group a numerical column in the data into different categories and use agg() to use multiple aggregate functions at once with groupby(). These are important techniques that allow us to create informative groups from numerical columns and understand multiple statistics of subsets of our data at once.
